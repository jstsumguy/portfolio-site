		<h2>What I Can Do</h2>
		<article>
			My most extensive experience has been fullstack development with Django/Python for <a href="www.mypropagatevocab.com" style="font-size: 2.0em;">Propagate Inc</a>, an education technology startup specializing in vocabularly learning software.  Nowadays, my goto language is Python, however I'm more than willing to use whatever will fit the bill for whichever project I may be working on.  Some of my favorite technologies I use on a daily basis are Python, Angular, and Node.
